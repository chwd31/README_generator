## Description

This project was created to for the user to ensure they have the minimum requirements for a README for their project.  By answering a few prompts, the generator will take the data and create a README in markdown for the user to add to their project page.  The generator will create a working table of contents and enter the data in the correct sections.  The README will be editable in case the user needs to make changes to the document.

## Installation

Steps to install the application:  Must have the latest version of Node.js installed. The user must also install a .gitingore file with node_modules and .DS_store included in the file for proper execution of the application.  The   user may also need to install node inquirer and fs on their system, or run rpm init if it does not function correctly to have the proper package.json files.

## Usage

To use the application, the user will run node on the index.js file.  This will take them through a series of prompts to develop their README file.  Once complete, the application will generate a README that will be saved to their local machine and in the git for which this application is stored.
